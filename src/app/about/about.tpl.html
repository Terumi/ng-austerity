    <code>ng-austerity</code> is a web version of the solitaire boardgame

  <h2>Why?</h2>

  <p>
    This small game is awesome, I really liked playing it in its physical form
    and wanted to be able to take it allong with me. This webversion should play
    nicely on a small screen like a mobile device.

  <h2>Can I Help?</h2>

  <p>
    Yes, please!

    If you are a AngularJS developer and want to join in, feel free to fork the
    code and send pull requests.
  </p>

  <p>
    The main thing needed is testing, find bug and file issues ! And tell me how
    friendly (or not) the UI is.
